#  Project Overview
Our project was inspired by the paper doll outfit creator game. We wanted to replicate this game into an online fun program. To do this, we created a drag and drop style game using a doll and her clothing items. We loved this game when we were younger, it was fun create a program that brought it back to life. 

# Instructions
The goal of this game is to create your favorite outfit. You can pick from the clothing surrounding the doll and drag it to dress her up. 

# The Process
We originally had a lot of trouble loading the images and making them fit how we wanted on the canvas. We had to get the right size of the background along with the doll and alter the clothes to fit the doll. This was a lot of downloading that made everything slow down and made us realize that we were downloading the images too big. 
We struggled at first to decide on which game we wanted to create. We both love fashion, and thought it would be so cool to create outfits effortless on a computer. We collected articles of clothing from pre-made assets. This was time consuming, trying to find clothes that matched what we had envisioned, things that we would wear. We ultimately had to settle for the clothes that we could find and would fit the doll. If we were to further improve this game with better programming knowledge, we would want to create and design the clothes to how we wanted them to look like. 

# Molly's Favorite Chunk of Code
My favorite part of our code is the constructor for Clothing. This part was interesting to work on because we had not used it in class before. It made it much easier to operate all of the pieces of clothing (images) to all do the same thing without writing out each individual item. We used `this.width` and `this.height` to represent the width and height of the images so that we could control all of the dimensions of the images with not as much code. 

# Anh's Favorite Chunk of Code
For this project, our favorite part of the code is the implementation of the pre-made assets found online. To add these, we added lines of code which were linked to the images we wanted to use. In addition these lines included descriptive names and the coordinates in the environment. This is our favorite piece of code as it was the most time consuming and difficult part of the project. After we finally got success with getting the code to work, it gave us a great amount of satisfaction and are very proud of it.
