How to Play the Game

Line up the ball where you choose but DO NOT let go of 
the mouse.

Once the mouse is released, the ball will shoot.

If you score, press the space bar and you can shoot again.

The counter will keep track of the amount of goals you
score in a row.

If you miss, bring the mouse to the restart button to reset
the ball and the counter.

What is our project? Our goal was to create an easy to play and easy to run game that was not only fun but relevant. 
Where did that lead us? Well, with the world cup going on, we figured what better time to incorporate soccer into a school project!? The goal was simple: make a game based on the foundation of soccer. Scoring a goal into the opponents net. Through adding in some background, emojis, various functions, loops, variables, and more we wanted to essentially have a moving net, a “press to shoot” ball, a score keeper, and a reset ability. In the end, we did just that.

The process: Throughout the creation of this program we faced
plenty of ups and downs. The initial process was simple, we 
had a strong group put together, a set idea, a clear cut plan, 
and some goals. However, like any project we hit bumps in the 
road. Whether it was stopping a loop, getting the ball to move 
the way we wanted, properly adding a counter, or just having a 
reset button, everything took trial and error. With the help of 
additional brain power and Mark Sherman’s magic innate ability to 
somehow make everything feel warm and fuzzy we successfully jumped 
through said obstacles and came out on the other side victorious.

Code we are proud of:

Colin: In terms of what I am most proud of, it has to be the 
change in speed of the goal after a goal is scored. This was 
not an originally intended feature of our game, but something 
we implemented during the creation that provided a fun and 
challenging twist. This was completed after including a speed 
variable that allows for the goal's speed to increase by one 
after each time the button is pressed to reset after a goal.

Jake: I’d have to say that starting and stopping the loop was 
my most proud moment and biggest achievement in the project. 
This is because we had to stop the loop every time a goal was 
scored for the counter to increase by one, opposed to infinite 
increments.
