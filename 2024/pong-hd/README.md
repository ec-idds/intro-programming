# Final Project
This Codio project is your final project workspace and turn-in. 

This project is configured using "pair programming" mode for collaboration. 
Read more about how that works here: https://docs.codio.com/students/courses/pair-programming.html#id1

You will write the instructions to use your program, and your final report, in this README file, replacing its current contents. 
You will use [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) format to write this file.

# Code Requirements
- Be a complete and working program, ready to demo
- Instructions & Documentation (for someone else to run and use the program, written in **this README file**, in Markdown)
- It should pass the "Check Code" linter completely cleanly.

# Report Document
- In this README file (using Markdown formatting)

- Brief description of the project (1 paragraph).

This is pong 2.8 HD Remastered, I thought of pong itself or that brick breaking game(I forgot the name) and I wanted to do my own version of those. I wanted to make a two player part and change up the game to make it more fun, Since OG pong gets boring after the first two goals.

- Instructions for the user (i.e. how to play)
W/S is player 1(left) paddle and arrow keys Up and Down are Player 2(right)
- Brief story of the process, including challenges and victories (less than 1 page).

I created the Title and game states first after making those I created the game itself with no power ups or anything, Just 2 player pong after that I tried to add everything all at once (Winner's mode and My Planned 5-5 mode), When it came time to make Winner's mode work. I had many clipping issues and the paddle just wouldn't follow each other/the whole game would be a paddle. I thought of jut adding them together to see if that would work with a little space in the middle, with making them "disappear" and then reappear when the score got over 4. After that huge win I went online to figure out how to add music and I found the code to put in, However I couldn't get it to stay on when I reloaded the page. So I found the "UserStartAudio" thing online and that finalized  the sounds  




- For each contributor, highlight a chunk of code you're particularly proud of, describe it, and explain why you like it so much (~1 paragraph each plus the code chunk).
	- pro tip: use [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code) to make your code blocks look good in the Readme
- Credits for any other resources you used.
	- Formatting is simple: if the license requires it, give the name, the link, and what license you're using it under.

# Submission
- Report: README.md
- All code in this Codio assignment (`sketch.js`, `index.html`, and any other files or assets)
- **To Submit:** mark this assignment as complete.

Once submitted, your project will be downloaded from Codio and put on the [Final Project Archive page](https://github.com/ec-idds/intro-programming) so that you can show your family and friends, and so future students can draw inspiration. If you do NOT want your project featured on the archive page, please tell the instructor.
