# Recommended

## View Project with Console
To see the errors and messages from your code, open the project viewer in a new browser window. This can be done by the pulldown menu attached to `▶️ Project Index (static)` in the top bar OR by opening the viewer and clicking the arrow button ↗️ to open in a new tab.

In that new window or tab, you can then open the browser's JavaScript Console, which is part of the developer tools included in every browser.

## 2-Column Layout
Go to the `View` menu, then `Layouts`, and select `2 Columns`. Then you can move the viewer to  one side and your code editor to the other and see them at the same time!


Welcome to Cam & Alyssa's final project for Intro. To Programming taught by Mark Sherman. 
In this project, you are able to color in a picture of Boston (Fenway Park).
This program is very much simiLar to a "color by number" game on your phone - just a lot more simple, 
and without the visual numbers with the associating colors. You have free range with how you color in the picture!

To run this program, simply press "sketch.js" on the left hand column. Once the code is opened, please launch
"project index (static)" at the upper right hand corner of the screen. It is found in-between "check code" and "configure". 

You will then be able to color in a picture, using a paint brush, and a color palette; with a variety of colors (upper left).

Unhappy with the coloring job performed? Simply press the "reset" button at the lower left of the picture. 

Enjoy!
