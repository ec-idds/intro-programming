## View Project with Console
To see the errors and messages from your code, open the project viewer in a new browser window. This can be done by the pulldown menu attached to `▶️ Project Index (static)` in the top bar OR by opening the viewer and clicking the arrow button ↗️ to open in a new tab.

In that new window or tab, you can then open the browser's JavaScript Console, which is part of the developer tools included in every browser.

## 2-Column Layout
Go to the `View` menu, then `Layouts`, and select `2 Columns`. Then you can move the viewer to  one side and your code editor to the other and see them at the same time!
