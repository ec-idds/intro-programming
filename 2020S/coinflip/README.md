# Coin-Flip

## Introduction
A Coin flip heads/tails simulator written in Javascript utilizing the P5 3D library. 
We were able to successfully create a cylinder with the faces of a quarter in a 3D canvas that flips at the press of the spacebar, have the program randomly select heads or tails, and implement a sound whenever the spacebar is pressed.

## Instructions
Press the spacebar to start the program, and use the text boxes labeled heads or tails to keep track of the score.
