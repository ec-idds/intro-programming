# Pet The Cat

## Description

Pet The Cat is a game where the player clicks on the canvas to start the game, and an image of a cat appears randomly within the canvas. The player then has 30 seconds to click the cat as many times as possible, and every time the cat is clicked, it moves around the screen a little faster. A timer and a score count appear in the top left corner to show how much time is left in the game in seconds and how many times the cat has been clicked successfully. A sound also plays every time the cat is clicked successfully, and a different sound plays to delineate the end of the game. The player can then click the canvas again to restart the game, and the score is reset to zero and the timer begins a new countdown. 

## What Was Accomplished

I was the only one in my group, so I completed the project on my own. I was able to accomplish everything I expected to accomplish, which was making the game work as intended and respond to user interaction, and it kept track of that interaction by increasing the score when the click was in the right place. I was actually able to fine-tune the game more than I originally expected by adding the ability to restart the game and play it more than once without having to restart the program itself. I also added sound effects and sped up the cat's movement a little bit each time it was clicked to make the game more difficult, which were two more additions that I didn't intend to have when I started the project. 

## What Was New

For this game I used sound, which we had not previously worked with at all, as well as millis, which we had only worked with minimally. I expanded upon our use of millis to create the game and connected it with mouse events and sound effects to bring everything together.
