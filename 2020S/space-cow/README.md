**Introduction**

For our final project, we created Space Cow, a game where a cow repeatedly leaps over a moon. We were intrigued by the Collide2d library and wanted to implement it into our code, to do that, we figured that a game would be the best option. We drew inspiration from the classic nursery rhyme, with the hope that someone of any age level could enjoy our game.

**Instruction**

The game is very simple, once it has begun, the moon is programmed to repeatedly wrap around the screen. Using the space key, the player is able to trigger the cow to jump. For every successful leap over the moon, the score will increase by one. However, if you collide with the moon, the game will cease and the text 'Game Over' will appear across the screen. If the player has the desire to play the game again and to beat their high score, they just need to refresh the page to play again. 

**Milestones**

Our original goal for the first milestone was to successfully program the moon to wraparound the screen and for the cow to jump when the spacebar was pressed. We also aimed to implement both Collide2d and the Sprites libraries, and although we were able to work Collide2d into the program, we decided it would be best to use images instead of the Sprites. For the final draft of the project, we aimed to add text to indicate when the game was over and to create a scoreboard, which would keep track of the player's succesful jumps before collision. We originally wanted to have multiple moons wrap around the screen to increase difficluty, but decided we wanted to keep it simple so that it could be enjoyable for all ages. 

**Credits** 

We decided that it would be easier for us to work collaboratively on the project over zoom, rather than splitting up the work indvidually. This allowed for us to bounce ideas off of one another without the delay that emails and text cause. We also utilized the local server's portal, which allowed us to work simultaneously on the sketch file.
